[feat] Link docs by identity, and let integrations add to the docs tree. (#6626)

A doc links another doc inside its text with `{@link [<provider>:]<kind>:<name>}`,
such as `{@link command:doctor}`. The CLI prints each link as the `astryx docs`
command that opens the doc; a link that names no doc prints as written, and
`astryx doctor` warns on it. An older CLI prints the link as plain text.
`reference`, `workflow`, and `collection` blocks stay in namespace docs.

An integration can ship namespace docs and place its guides in them. They show
up in `astryx docs` beside `cli`, with the same moves, links, and search, and
`astryx doctor integration docs` checks them before the package ships. A
namespace doc in an integration's docs directory no longer fails to load, and
`astryx integration add doc <name> --parent <namespace>` writes a placed guide.

Every flat topic now sits in `astryx docs unorganized`, under its own name,
so every doc has a place in the tree with a way up and across. Search hits
for a topic name the level and the package that wrote it.

New guide: `astryx docs cli/writing-docs`.
