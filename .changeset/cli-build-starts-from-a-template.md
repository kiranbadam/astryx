[feat] `astryx build "<idea>"` now always names a page template to start from.

A page template carries the page frame, the spacing, and the section rhythm. A page composed from components has to rediscover them. Before, the kit recommended scaffolding only when a template matched almost by name. Other ideas got "use it as a layout reference", which pointed at a 35-line `--skeleton`, and an idea that no template matched got "frame with AppShell, then compose". Now:

- `start` names the template to scaffold, with its `template <name> <path>` command, a `basis`, a one-line `reason`, and `alternatives`: the next two templates. A page ranker built for the long ideas builders write ("ops dashboard with a KPI row, a sortable table and a trend chart") picks it. Every matched word counts, weighted by how rare it is among page templates. The words before the first "with", ":" or "," name the page's family, a container ("in a modal") names its frame, and a word that only modifies another ("product" in "product response") counts half. A family's base template (`dashboard`, `settings`) leads its family unless a variant's own words outweigh it. Family words come from the templates' own ids. `basis` is `direct` when the ranker's pick is also search's direct match, `closest` when it is not, and `fallback` when nothing has the evidence to lead and the page starts from the `shell-top-nav` app shell (`blank` when that is not available). A template that is not ready yet is never the start.
- Search matches words more strictly. A term matches inside a name or keyword only at the start of one of its words ("input" finds `TextInput`, "file" no longer finds "profile"), plurals and stems count as the same word, and typo tolerance applies only to one-word lookups of words long enough that one edit rarely makes another word ("site" no longer matches "side", nor "cable" "table").
- Blocks and components that matched only one description word of a multi-word idea are no longer offered.
- The text output has four sections: TEMPLATE (with its reason and command), OTHER TEMPLATES, BLOCKS, and COMPONENTS (with the frame and foundation names). They replace RECOMMENDED START and PAGE TEMPLATES. Descriptions stop at their first sentence, and blocks and components show the top three, each with one shared command line. `--verbose` shows everything. The recommended command is now `template <name> <path>`, not `template <name> --skeleton` or `component AppShell`.

The `build` playbook, the generated agent docs, and the `working-with-ai` and `layout` guides now start every page from a template.

Compatibility: the `build.kit` JSON only gains `start`. Every existing field keeps its shape and meaning. Which pages, blocks, and components are listed, and `directMatch`, change with the stricter matching, as ranking results do. The human-readable output is reorganized. Options, exit codes, and the `build.help` shape are unchanged, and `build` still writes nothing. The same matching changes the ranking of `search` results.
