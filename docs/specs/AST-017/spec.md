## Intent

Give contributors and reviewers one rule for deciding whether a change is
`[breaking]`: identify an installed consumer whose valid use of the latest stable
release stops working unchanged.

The label is a compatibility classification, not a risk or severity score. A
small, safe rename can be breaking; a large rewrite can be nonbreaking when it
preserves the released contract.

For CLI controls, keep every supported behavior discoverable and put each control on
the narrowest surface that owns it. Global controls require evidence that their value
and meaning are global. Cross-cutting guarantees must be complete, observable, and
independent for each invocation.

## Non-goals

- Freezing implementation details or every byte of generated example code.
- Defining component or template naming conventions.
- Treating private packages, canaries, unreleased work, or explicitly marked
  experimental surfaces as stable public API.
- Replacing the release process, Changesets, or migration tooling.

## Requirements

- **FR1 — Breaking changes need a released victim.** A change is breaking only
  when a valid consumer scenario supported by the latest stable release of a
  published package no longer works unchanged, or produces an incompatible
  result under a documented stable contract. The review names that scenario and
  the released surface it uses.
- **FR2 — Classify against the latest stable release.** A surface added and then
  renamed, removed, or reworked before any stable release has no installed
  consumer and is not breaking. Private or ignored packages are outside the
  published compatibility promise. Promotion from a private package into a
  published package is additive from the published side.
- **FR3 — Released contracts include behavior, not only types.** Compatibility
  covers public exports and import paths; requiredness, accepted values, defaults,
  return types, callbacks, and error behavior; documented interaction and
  accessibility behavior; stable CLI command names, options, exit behavior, and
  machine-readable schemas; and other explicitly documented public extension
  points. Internal implementation, undocumented markup, and source layout are not
  stable merely because a consumer can observe them.
- **FR4 — Preserved old usage is nonbreaking.** A rename or replacement is
  nonbreaking when the old released call, import, option, identifier, or input
  continues to work with equivalent meaning through a compatibility alias or
  adapter. A deprecation may warn and point to the replacement, but removing that
  compatibility path is the breaking event.
- **FR5 — Additive and contract-restoring changes are nonbreaking.** New optional
  capabilities, new components, new commands, broader accepted inputs, and new
  templates are nonbreaking when old usage is unchanged. A fix that restores the
  already-documented contract is nonbreaking even when it changes faulty output.
  A proposal that intentionally replaces the documented contract is not a fix for
  classification purposes.
- **FR6 — Risk does not override compatibility.** Low adoption, low likelihood,
  engineering approval, or confidence that affected callers are uncommon does not
  make an incompatible released contract nonbreaking. Conversely, implementation
  size, visual scope, or review difficulty does not make a compatible change
  breaking.
- **FR7 — The Changeset category follows the classification.** A published
  breaking change uses a `[breaking]` Changeset. While Astryx packages remain on
  `0.x`, that category carries a minor bump; every nonbreaking published category
  carries a patch bump. Documentation-only, test-only, and private-package-only
  changes need no Changeset. `pnpm changeset:new` is the authoring path and
  `pnpm check:changesets` enforces the current category/bump coupling. Classify
  each published package update in multi-package work. A fixed-group version-only
  co-bump needs no Changeset entry by itself, but a generated dependency or peer
  range edit is part of that package's update and must be classified and named in a
  Changeset. When categories differ, use separate Changesets so every package entry
  follows its own classification.
- **FR8 — Migration evidence matches the affected surface.** Every breaking change
  names the old valid usage, the replacement, and how consumers migrate. Supply an
  `astryx upgrade` codemod when consumer source can be rewritten mechanically.
  When no source rewrite is possible, provide an explicit compatibility alias or
  concrete replacement instructions rather than inventing a vacuous codemod.
- **FR9 — Template slugs are mutable catalog data.** A template slug identifies an
  entry in the current template catalog; it is data about that template, not a
  contractual CLI API. Renaming a slug is nonbreaking even when
  `astryx template <old-slug>` no longer resolves. The Changeset and release note
  describe the catalog rename so builders can find the new value, but the rename
  does not use the `[breaking]` category or require an alias or codemod.
- **FR10 — Template content and metadata are expected to evolve.** Adding a
  template, rebuilding its starter source, or changing its slug, human-facing
  name, description, category, keywords, or example data is nonbreaking while the
  CLI's stable command and machine-readable schema contracts remain compatible.
  Generated starter code is not promised byte-for-byte stability across releases,
  and existing projects are not rewritten when a template improves.
- **FR11 — The CLI contract surrounds the catalog.** The `template` command name,
  supported options, exit behavior, and machine-readable response schema are
  contractual surfaces under FR3. Individual catalog values returned through that
  schema, including template slugs, names, descriptions, categories, keywords, and
  starter content, are not independently stable API identifiers.
- **FR12 — Supported inter-package ranges are contracts.** For an update to a
  published package, its latest stable release's documented installation scenarios
  and declared dependency or peer ranges define the supported companion package
  versions. The update is breaking for that package when upgrading it alone makes
  any such combination stop working unchanged, including by narrowing or raising
  the range. A coordinated upgrade that works does not change that classification.
  A dependency bump is not breaking when every previously supported combination
  keeps working. Keep every previously supported version in range and provide an
  adapter when needed; otherwise classify the narrower or higher-floor range as
  breaking, describe the range change in its Changeset release note, and meet FR8's
  migration obligation.
- **FR13 — Stable machine schemas project every field.** A stable CLI response
  contract includes fields inside discriminated `data` entries as well as the
  outer envelope. Every field is present in the canonical response type, contract
  tests, text projection where the command provides one, and complete
  consumer-facing schema documentation. Adding an optional field is nonbreaking
  when old consumers continue unchanged, but it remains a public schema update and
  does not bypass current-authority review or documentation.
- **FR14 — No supported CLI behavior is hidden.** Any Astryx CLI behavior
  available in a supported flow—including behavior selected automatically and
  behavior selected by an Astryx-owned control—is a public surface and MUST be
  documented and discoverable. Every caller-settable control that changes command
  selection, work, output, side effects, or exit behavior is part of that surface,
  whether spelled as a command, option, positional argument, package field, or
  configuration key. The CLI MUST NOT define or read an Astryx-owned environment
  variable for any purpose. A variable is Astryx-owned when Astryx defines its
  semantics, regardless of its name or prefix; standard platform variables remain
  outside this prohibition unless Astryx assigns them an Astryx-specific meaning.
  Automation MUST use the documented programmatic API.
  Public controls MUST define their accepted values, default, precedence and
  interactions, error behavior, and a representative invocation. Commands and
  options MUST appear in generated help and the machine-readable manifest.
  Automatic behavior and other controls MUST either appear there or be linked from
  those discovery surfaces to consumer documentation. A
  normal invocation mode MUST have a documented command, option, or configuration
  surface. Private test hooks and maintainer rollout gates MAY affect tests,
  diagnostics, or staged availability without becoming public controls, but they MUST
  NOT use environment variables, require action from supported consumers, or serve as
  the sole interface to a supported mode. The user-facing behavior they gate remains
  subject to this requirement once supported.
- **FR15 — Global controls require CLI-wide value and semantics.** An option is
  global when the root parser accepts it across commands or the manifest lists it in
  `globalOptions`. A new behavior-changing option MAY be global only when it
  represents one coherent CLI-wide invariant, solves a demonstrated
  supported-consumer need that a narrower surface cannot solve, and has defined,
  meaningful, non-no-op behavior for every executable command and subcommand. The proposal MUST enumerate those surfaces
  from generated help and the machine-readable manifest and state the control's
  behavior, output or error effect, and verification for each one. A command on
  which the control has no meaningful effect is evidence that the proposed scope is too broad. A behavior that applies to only part of the
  CLI MUST be placed on the nearest command, command group, or programmatic API that
  owns it. The same name MUST keep the same meaning throughout that scope, and names
  MUST describe the exact controlled capability rather than make broad claims such as
  `safe`, `secure`, `trusted`, or `isolated`. A safety or trust control MUST also
  define its trust boundary and fail closed before untrusted input can execute or
  cause a side effect.
- **FR16 — Cross-cutting guarantees define and close their boundary.** A claim that
  prevents a class of execution, data access, or side effect MUST define the trusted
  inputs, denied actions, and the points where protection begins and ends. It MUST
  cover every current entry point and fail closed for an unknown or newly added
  extension point.
- **FR17 — Suppressed work is observable.** When a safety or reduced-capability
  control intentionally omits a normally available source, capability, or unit of
  work, every successful machine-readable result MUST identify the active mode and
  what category was omitted. Human-readable output MUST project the same fact. A
  partial or empty result MUST NOT look like an ordinary complete success. If the
  operation cannot produce a useful conforming result, it MUST return a stable
  structured error and, for the CLI, a nonzero exit code before any write or external
  side effect.
- **FR18 — Programmatic controls are explicit and invocation-scoped.** A
  programmatic control MUST be an explicit API input and MUST NOT depend on ambient
  mutable process state. Concurrent calls MUST be able to select different values
  independently. When the CLI and programmatic API expose the same control, they MUST
  share accepted values, defaults, precedence, observable behavior, and error
  semantics.
- **FR19 — Configuration is admitted only on evidence.** A new configuration key,
  or a new accepted value that changes CLI behavior, MUST be justified by a
  reproducible supported-consumer case in which automatic detection and
  established project conventions produce the wrong result. The proposal MUST
  record that case and the convention it tried first. When an established
  convention or automatic detection can express the need, the CLI MUST use it
  instead of adding configuration. Configuration MUST NOT duplicate a value the
  CLI can derive.
- **FR20 — Integration contributions compose predictably and visibly.** A
  configuration setting MAY accept contributions from integrations only when its
  entry in the public configuration contract (the exported `AstryxConfig` type
  and the configuration schema reference consumers read through the CLI) states:
  that integrations may contribute; the exact form of a contribution; how the app
  value and all contributions combine, and in what order; the one documented
  control through which an app refuses inherited contributions; and what happens
  when a contribution fails. The setting owns that rule; an integration cannot
  change it. An integration declares each contribution statically in its
  integration module, either as a field of the exported `AstryxIntegration`
  manifest type or as a documented named export, and the integration authoring
  reference documents that form. Importing an integration module MUST NOT
  contribute anything as a side effect. The CLI MUST let a caller inspect the
  effective value of each such setting and the source of each part (the app or a
  named integration) through a documented command or programmatic API. Unless a
  setting's contract states and justifies otherwise: app and integration
  contributions combine rather than replace one another; the app's own value
  applies first, then integrations in their resolved order; a failing
  contribution is skipped without removing the others or changing the command's
  result; the app refuses all inherited contributions through one documented
  control; and loading the project more than once in one invocation applies each
  contribution once. No integration contribution can remove or weaken a value
  supplied by the app or by another integration. When a setting protects the
  project, a failed contribution MUST fail closed instead of being skipped.
- **FR21 — Experimental APIs are explicit and opt-in before publication.** A
  public surface inside a stable published package is outside the stable
  compatibility promise only when its first stable release exposes it through a
  canonical experimental boundary and marks it in both declarations and consumer
  documentation. On an existing stable component, experimental props and callbacks
  live inside one optional `experimental` prop object; omitting that object preserves
  the component's stable defaults and behavior. Experimental hooks, functions, and
  types use the owning component's `/experimental` import subpath and are not
  re-exported from the package root or the component's ordinary subpath. Declarations
  carry `@experimental`; authored docs carry machine-readable
  `stability: 'experimental'` metadata and state that the surface may change or be
  removed in a patch release. Prose-only warnings and reviewer knowledge do not
  establish this boundary.
- **FR22 — Experimental changes are patch-level and stay confined.** Adding,
  changing, renaming, or removing an explicitly experimental surface uses an
  `[experimental]` Changeset and a patch bump. An incompatibility confined to that
  boundary is `[experimental]`, not `[breaking]`; the Changeset authoring and
  validation process MUST derive and enforce a patch bump for the category even when
  the experimental surface changes incompatibly. Its release note names the affected
  surface and replacement when one exists. A compatibility alias is optional; a
  codemod is supplied when a mechanical migration would materially reduce caller
  work. This exception never covers a change to stable defaults, stable runtime or
  accessibility behavior, ordinary import paths, non-experimental props, or stable
  CLI commands and machine schemas; those changes follow FR1–FR8. A released stable
  surface cannot be retroactively demoted to experimental.
- **FR23 — Promotion creates a stable contract deliberately.** Promotion is an
  owner-approved change that removes the experimental marker, exposes the settled
  prop, callback, hook, function, or type on its normal stable surface, and uses a
  `[feat]` Changeset. From that release forward, FR1–FR8 protect the promoted surface.
  Moving a component API out of the `experimental` prop object or moving an export
  out of a component's `/experimental` subpath names the stable replacement and
  supplies a codemod when the rewrite is mechanical. Keeping a deprecated
  experimental alias for a transition is encouraged but is not itself part of the
  new stable promise.
- **FR24 — Experimental status is verified per public surface.** Release review
  compares the previous published surface with current declarations and authored
  docs, verifies that their experimental markers agree, and rejects an
  `[experimental]` Changeset when any incompatible delta reaches a stable surface.
  The integration-theme contribution capability is the one grandfathered surface:
  its introduction in 0.6.3 is treated as experimental even though it predates the
  markers in FR21, and no other released surface may be enrolled retroactively. Its
  contribution metadata, discovery, and authoring contract may evolve in patch
  releases until an explicit promotion removes the marker. The surrounding stable
  CLI command names, options, exit behavior, and machine-readable envelope remain
  protected under FR3 and FR13.

### Platform support

- Supported feature/engine floor: every published Astryx package and stable CLI
  release.
- Unsupported behavior: private packages, unreleased branch state, canary-only
  surfaces, and surfaces that meet FR21's explicit experimental contract carry no
  stable compatibility promise.
- Browser evidence: not applicable to the classification itself; a browser-owned
  compatibility claim still follows the governing component or platform spec.

## Current-state impact

The release tooling already enforces `[breaking]` to minor and every other
category to patch while packages are on `0.x`. The Release Process already limits
migration obligations to released surfaces. The template contribution guide notes
that template resolution is exact-match, but that lookup mechanic does not turn a
slug value into a contractual API.

The repository already isolates whole experimental components in the canary-only
Lab package, but it has no equivalent boundary for a new prop, callback, hook, or
type on an existing stable component. This amendment adds that per-surface boundary
without weakening the component around it. The release tooling and public Release
Process do not yet support the `[experimental]` category or verify declaration/doc
markers. Before another surface uses the contract, follow-up implementation must add
the category to Changeset authoring, CI validation, changelog grouping, and the
Release Process, with tests that prove even an incompatible experimental-only change
stays patch-level. Integration-theme contributions are the sole grandfathered
enrollment and may use existing patch categories until the dedicated category ships.
Open PR #6615 removes the released `layout` command, which was experimental only in
practice and carried no contract marker; it remains breaking and is not enrolled by
this amendment.

This spec supplies the missing classification rule shared by those documents. In
particular, both CLI-template cases discussed during review are nonbreaking catalog
updates:

- renaming a template slug changes data about the current template and may make the
  previous value stop resolving; and
- changing or completely rebuilding the template's emitted starter page updates
  content for future generations without modifying projects that already copied it.

The stable compatibility boundary remains the CLI operation and complete response
schema, not the individual entries currently present in the template catalog.
Nested entry fields are public schema even when optional; their type, tests, text
projection where present, and consumer schema documentation move together.

The CLI already generates command help, README tables, and a machine-readable
manifest. This amendment extends that discoverability standard to every supported
behavior, including automatic behavior and controls outside command syntax. Existing
Astryx-owned environment controls are non-conforming and must move to documented
commands, options, configuration, or programmatic APIs; this record does not choose
their individual migrations. Removing an existing variable still follows FR3–FR8:
a breaking removal needs concrete migration guidance, and silently ignoring the old
input is not a migration. This record does not authorize any specific global control.
A future proposal must prove meaningful behavior across every command under FR15 or place the control on the narrower command and API surfaces that own the
behavior. These decisions change policy only, so they do not change runtime output or
a published package and require no Changeset.

The existing `debug` setting is the reference behavior for FR20: the app handler
and every integration handler run, the app first; a throwing handler is skipped
without affecting the others or the command; `inheritDebug: false` in the
package's `astryx` field refuses inherited handlers; and a repeated project load
delivers each event once. Its configuration schema entry states that rule, and
the `cli/integrations` guide documents the `debug` named export. Draft
AST-031 details the same model for runtime handler features. No command yet
reports an effective contributed value with its sources, so existing contributed
settings do not meet FR20's inspection requirement; this record does not choose
that command. FR19 applies to new configuration; this amendment does not
reclassify existing keys.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Breaking means a released consumer must change

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-02`

Classify compatibility from the latest stable published contract and name the
consumer scenario that stops working. This makes labels predictable, keeps
unreleased and private experimentation free to change, and prevents low-risk but
incompatible edits from hiding in patch releases.

Rejected: classifying by implementation size, perceived risk, reviewer confidence,
or any observable difference. Those tests either miss real contract breakage or
freeze implementation details and data values that were never promised.

### DEC-2 — Template slugs and source are mutable catalog data

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-02`

Treat a template slug as data describing the current catalog entry, alongside its
name, description, category, keywords, and starter content. Those values may evolve
in patch releases, including a slug rename that makes the previous value stop
resolving. The release note should make the new value discoverable, but the change
is not `[breaking]` and needs no compatibility alias or codemod.

Keep the surrounding CLI operation contractual: incompatible changes to the
`template` command, its options, exit behavior, or machine-readable schema still
follow the normal breaking-change rule. This lets the template library improve
without confusing current catalog contents with the interface that serves them.

Rejected: treating a slug as stable API merely because it is interpolated into an
exact CLI invocation. That would freeze catalog data and discourage clearer naming
without protecting a contract the template system intends to make.

### DEC-3 — Package updates keep their own range promises

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-3`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-03`

Treat the latest stable package's declared dependency or peer range and documented
installation scenario as its compatibility promise. Consumers may upgrade that
package with any companion version the range still allows; a coordinated release
cannot require an undeclared lockstep upgrade. Classify the package update that
creates the mismatch. Supporting package updates keep their own classifications.
A coordinated breaking range change remains allowed when its Changeset release note
describes the new range and its FR8 migration tells consumers how to move.

Rejected: marking every dependency bump breaking, which would freeze compatible
maintenance, or calling an update nonbreaking merely because a coordinated upgrade
works, which would break supported independent consumers.

### DEC-4 — Stable CLI response fields receive complete projections

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-4`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-06`

Treat every field in a stable machine-readable CLI response—including nested
entry fields—as public schema. Keep its canonical type, contract tests, applicable
text output, and complete consumer documentation aligned in the same change.

An optional field addition may remain nonbreaking when old consumers continue
unchanged. That compatibility result does not make the field private or waive
current-authority and documentation requirements.

Rejected: documenting only the outer envelope, relying on implementation typedefs
as consumer documentation, or treating a response-entry field as mutable catalog
data merely because the value it carries may evolve.

### DEC-5 — Supported CLI behavior is never hidden

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-5`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-23`

Any Astryx CLI behavior available in a supported flow is public and must be
documented and discoverable, including behavior selected automatically. A control
that can change supported CLI behavior is public and must be documented and
discoverable. Its status follows the behavior it changes, not whether it is spelled
as a command, option, package field, or configuration key.

Use an option for invocation-scoped behavior, placed on the nearest command or
command group that owns it; a global option must meet FR15's CLI-wide evidence bar.
Use a documented configuration surface for persistent project behavior. Do not
introduce Astryx-owned environment variables, including aliases for another surface.
Automation uses the documented programmatic API. Private tests use injected test
seams instead of environment variables. A maintainer rollout gate may control staged
availability, but it is not a public user interface, must not use an environment
variable, and cannot be the only way to reach a supported mode. The user-facing
behavior it gates becomes subject to this requirement once supported.

Rejected: documented or undocumented environment-variable controls, naming a hidden
rollout gate as the user interface, or describing a behavior only in prose while
omitting it—or a direct link to its documentation—from generated help and the
machine-readable manifest.

### DEC-6 — Global CLI controls prove global value

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-6`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-23`

Treat a behavior-changing global control as a last resort, not as the default home for
invocation-scoped behavior. Because it changes every command, it requires current
system-spec authority before implementation. Its proposal must show one stable
invariant with meaningful behavior for every command, a supported-consumer need that
narrower command or API scope cannot satisfy, and a manifest-derived command matrix that verifies the claim. A
no-op or different meaning on any command means the control is scoped too broadly.

Put narrower behavior on the nearest command, command group, or programmatic API that
owns it. Name the control for the exact capability it changes rather than using broad
quality claims such as `safe`, `secure`, `trusted`, or `isolated`. A safety or trust
control also defines its trust boundary and fails closed before untrusted input can
execute or cause a side effect.

Rejected: making a control global because several implementations share a switch,
because root parsing is convenient, or because unrelated commands can silently ignore
it. Those approaches enlarge the public surface without establishing coherent value.

### DEC-7 — Cross-cutting controls are complete, observable, and per invocation

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-7`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-23`

Define a cross-cutting guarantee by its complete boundary, not by the current list of
implementation sites. Unknown and future extension points fail closed.

Make work omitted by a safety or reduced-capability mode part of the result contract
so a partial result cannot be mistaken for a complete one. When no useful result
remains, return a stable error before writes or external effects. Pass programmatic controls as explicit inputs, keep
them independent across concurrent calls, and preserve semantics across equivalent CLI
and API surfaces.

Rejected: best-effort interception of known loaders, silent fallback to partial or
empty results, process-global mutable switches, and separate CLI and API meanings. Each can
make the advertised guarantee false while the happy-path tests remain green.

### DEC-8 — Configuration is a last resort, and contributions compose

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-8`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-23`

Every configuration key is permanent public surface under FR3 and FR14, and it
asks every consumer to make a decision. A key often hides a gap in detection, so
detection and established conventions come first, and a new key needs a
reproduced case where they fail.

Integration contributions let one package set shared behavior once, as the
`debug` setting does for organization-wide debug logs, while the app keeps the
final say. The setting defines how contributions combine; an integration only
declares its contribution, in the documented form. Contributions combine with the
app value instead of replacing it, they are isolated from one another, each part
of the effective value can be traced to its source, and a protective setting
fails closed.

Rejected: adding a key because it is easy to add, a key that duplicates a
convention or a derivable value, an integration silently replacing an app value,
an integration defining its own merge rule, contributions made by import side
effects, and one broken integration disabling a setting for every app.

### DEC-9 — Existing stable components incubate APIs behind one explicit boundary

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-9`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-28`

Keep Lab as the canary-only home for an entire experimental component. When an
existing stable component needs to test a new prop or callback, put it inside the
component's optional `experimental` prop object so every callsite opts in visibly
and the ordinary prop namespace stays stable. Put experimental hooks, functions,
and types on the owning component's `/experimental` subpath. Mark the same surface
in declarations and authored docs, and keep stable defaults unchanged when the
experimental boundary is unused.

Allow those marked surfaces to evolve through `[experimental]` patch releases.
Promotion is a separate `[feat]` decision that moves the settled API onto its stable
surface; after that release the ordinary compatibility rules apply. Never use an
experimental marker to demote an already stable contract. Integration-theme
contributions are the single grandfathered exception because they shipped before
this declaration mechanism while still being introduced for early iteration.

Rejected: moving a stable component into Lab to test one new API, scattering
`unstableFoo` names through its ordinary prop namespace, relying on prose warnings
that tooling cannot verify, treating every recently added API as implicitly
experimental, and retroactively marking another released stable surface unstable.
