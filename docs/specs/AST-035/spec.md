# Integration template replacement system spec

## Intent

Let an installed integration provide the project-specific implementation of a Core
template without making the common lookup ambiguous or removing access to the Core
original.

## Non-goals

- Replacing integration components or reference-doc topics. Those surfaces own their
  own contracts.
- Rewriting template source that a consumer already copied into an app.
- Making an integration template available when its source or metadata is invalid.
- Selecting an integration that the project neither configures nor autolinks.

## Requirements

- **FR1 — A template declares its own replacement.** An integration template MAY
  set `replaces` in its own metadata to an existing Core template id. No
  package-level map declares replacements (`spec:AST-039/FR11`). The field is part
  of the strict template metadata object, so CLIs before 0.7.0 reject it; an
  integration that uses it MUST declare `@astryxdesign/cli >=0.7.0`.
- **FR2 — A valid replacement owns default discovery.** When one valid declaration
  applies, unqualified template lookup and default template projections MUST use the
  integration template for the Core id. The integration template MUST remain
  addressable by its own id. List, search, build suggestions, Project discovery, and
  block-layout lookup MUST project the same winner.
- **FR3 — Explicit package selection preserves alternatives.** Selecting
  `@astryxdesign/core` MUST address the original Core template. Selecting an
  integration package MUST retain access to its shadowed or rejected template by its
  own id.
- **FR4 — Invalid declarations fail closed.** A missing Core target, template-kind
  mismatch, a declaration on a template that cannot be used, or more than one
  declaration for one target inside a package MUST be an error. An invalid set MUST NOT replace Core. Valid integration
  templates remain available by their own ids when replacement metadata alone is
  invalid.
- **FR5 — Precedence is deterministic.** When multiple explicitly configured
  integrations validly replace one target, the integration configured later wins and
  the CLI reports a warning. An explicitly configured replacement MUST win over an
  autolinked replacement. When only autolinked integrations validly replace one
  target, the dependency listed later in package.json wins with a warning; naming
  the intended package in `astryx.config` makes precedence explicit. Invalid
  autolinked declarations remain reportable but MUST NOT disable a valid explicit
  replacement.
- **FR6 — Omission preserves selection behavior for valid integrations.** Without
  `replaces`, valid template selection and package-aware ambiguity remain
  unchanged. FR9 intentionally changes failure isolation with or without the field.
- **FR7 — Diagnostics are complete and stable.** `astryx doctor integration templates`
  MUST report intentional replacements, missing targets, declarations on templates
  that cannot be used, kind mismatches, and same-package ambiguity. Error findings MUST produce exit code
  1 and MUST NOT be followed by a false success message.
- **FR8 — Public schema projection is complete.** Effective `template.list` entries
  MAY include optional `replaces`. The response type, generated inventory, terminal
  projection, consumer documentation, and tests MUST describe that field and the
  expanded integration-template diagnostic behavior together.
- **FR9 — Failure isolation preserves valid contributions.** An error in one
  contribution kind MUST remain reportable without removing the integration's other
  valid contribution kinds. Within template and component discovery, one unusable file
  MUST NOT remove valid siblings. Other kinds keep their existing per-kind atomicity. A
  manifest load failure still withdraws the integration because no contribution roots
  are trustworthy. This rule applies whether or not any template declares `replaces`.

### Platform support

- Minimum CLI for an integration that declares `replaces`: `@astryxdesign/cli
  > =0.7.0`. Earlier CLIs parse template metadata strictly: they reject the field,
  > print one warning, and withhold the package's templates and doc topics, while
  > its components still load.
- Replacement selection itself starts in `@astryxdesign/cli 0.7.0`, the release
  produced by this breaking minor changeset.
- Browser evidence: not applicable to catalog selection. A generated consumer app
  MUST still build or run when its selected template renders integration-owned
  navigation.

## Current-state impact

The template metadata type and parser gain one optional field, `replaces`. Shared template
resolution becomes the owner for replacement validation, precedence, aliases, and the
default discovery view. Template commands, search/build, Project, layout, Doctor,
response documentation, and the integration-authoring guide project that result.
Project reports invalid contributions while retaining other valid contribution kinds
and valid template or component siblings.

The field is optional, and valid templates keep their selection behavior when it is
absent. The overall release is breaking: a winning replacement removes its
Core target from the default `template.list` response, every
`IntegrationTemplateConflict` gains required `relationship`, and its `severity` can
now be `info`. The changeset uses a minor bump under 0.x and includes migration
instructions as required by `spec:AST-017/FR8`. Optional `replaces` is projected
across every public response surface under `spec:AST-017/FR13`.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Replacement declarations live on the integration manifest

**Reference:** `spec:AST-035/DEC-1`
**Proposed by:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-11`
**Superseded by:** `spec:AST-035/DEC-3` and `spec:AST-039/DEC-4`, `2026-09-24`

Use `templateReplacements: Record<integrationTemplateId, coreTemplateId>` on the
integration manifest. This makes intent explicit. CLIs from 0.5.3 onward ignore the
field when it is unknown without rejecting understood contributions; integrations
that use it must not claim compatibility with 0.5.2 or earlier. Replacement selection
starts in 0.7.0.

Rejected: adding `replaces` directly to `TemplateDoc`. A CLI released before that
field would reject the strict metadata object and make the integration template
unavailable instead of degrading cleanly.

### DEC-2 — Explicit project configuration owns replacement precedence

**Reference:** `spec:AST-035/DEC-2`
**Proposed by:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-11`

Use configuration order when more than one explicitly configured package replaces a
target, and prefer any explicit replacement over autolinking. This keeps the
consumer-authored config authoritative while making valid conflicts deterministic and
visible.

Rejected: making every cross-package replacement ambiguous. That would prevent a
consumer from intentionally composing integrations in a declared order. Also
rejected: letting autolinking override explicit config merely because it is appended
to discovery later.

### DEC-3 — A template declares its own replacement

**Reference:** `spec:AST-035/DEC-3`
**Proposed by:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-24`

Put `replaces` in the integration template's own metadata. Every integration item
keeps its per-item metadata in its own descriptor (`spec:AST-039/FR11`), and doc
topics already declare replacement with the same field. The cost: a CLI older than
0.7.0 rejects the unknown field and withholds the package's templates and doc
topics, where the manifest map let it fall back to own-id access. Integration
themes in 0.7.0 already need a 0.7.0 CLI, so this adds no new kind of break;
integrations that use `replaces` declare `@astryxdesign/cli >=0.7.0`.

Rejected: `templateReplacements` in the manifest (DEC-1). It is a central catalog of
per-item data, which `spec:AST-039/FR11` forbids for every kind.

## Open questions

None. The CLI owner accepted the contract on 2026-09-23 and moved FR1 to
per-template `replaces` on 2026-09-24 (DEC-3).
