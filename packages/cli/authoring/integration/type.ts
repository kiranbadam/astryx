 * plain object against {@link AstryxIntegration}; the CLI validates it via
 * `parseIntegration` at the load boundary.
 *
 * The manifest module may also carry `debug` and `gapReport` NAMED exports.
 * They are not fields here on purpose: a CLI released before a given manifest
 * field existed could reject it and lose every contribution, while an unknown
 * named export is simply not read. See `astryx docs cli/integrations`.
