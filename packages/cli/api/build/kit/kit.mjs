/**
 * @file build.kit leaf — the page template to start from, and the kit around it.
 *
 * Every kit names a page template to START from: the page the page ranker
 * (rank.mjs) puts first when it has the evidence to lead, else the app shell.
 * The ranker is the only thing that picks the start, so one noisy signal —
 * search matching "site" to a gallery's "side" — cannot choose the page. A
 * template carries the page frame, the spacing, and the section rhythm; a page
 * composed from components carries none of that, so the kit never recommends
 * composing from scratch while a template exists. Next to the start it names
 * the ranker's next two templates, then groups the unified search into the
 * blocks that cover parts and the domain components to fill gaps, plus the
 * always-on frame + foundation names. `pages` and `directMatch` keep search's
 * own view for callers that read them.
 *
 * The kit carries RAW `SearchResultEntry` objects and static name arrays only —
 * never pre-formatted command strings. All CLI prefixing (formatCliCommand /
 * getCliInvocation) and the section prose live in the command renderer, so the
 * JSON shape stays package-manager-agnostic and stable across environments.
 *
 * Two commands are the kit's own: `start.command`, the scaffold (`astryx
 * template <name> <path>`, with `<path>` a placeholder), and the `--skeleton`
 * a page entry carries when it is not a direct match, so a loose page reads
 * as a layout preview rather than the thing to build. Neither is prefixing —
 * the invocation stays the renderer's job.
